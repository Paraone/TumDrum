# Tum Drum

Tum Drum is a cross between Simon and Guitar hero.

You are a drummer. It's your time to perform! Tum Drum follows all the 
basic rules of the game Simon with some added bonuses, including, a drum pad
istead of some lame beeping buttons, A background song that gives a rhythm 
to the sequence you follow and animated sprites to show your progression in the game.

Technologies Used:

	jQuery.js

	All Imagery used in Tum Drum were taken from Google images for the sole
	purpose of creating this project. They are not original art and are used as

	would be re-created.
